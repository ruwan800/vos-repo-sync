how we do it:
	function call comes file pointer
		and main andsub cats
	we read the file pointer with readline()
	then put them in our tempdb


for line in file
	if first char is blank
		if it has only 3 char
			add "\n" to desc_more
		else
			strip first space
			add to desc_more 
	else strip it
		partition it by ":"
		if first part is what we need
			set it as we need it
		else if its not one what we needed, put it into moreInfo
		else if line has only 1 char
			create a string

	if we got 100 of them create sql query and exec it put into sc_temp


let sql do the rest. thats fast

what we need on python
	dbconnect
	readline
	method to get the first char
		char = string[0]
	method to get the length of str (len(str))
		len(string)
	"".format()
	//while loop in python(not needed: for line in file: works )
	method similar to php addslashes
		def replaceSpecialChars(text):
			speecialChars = { "&":"&amp;", "\"":"&quot;", "'":"&#039;", "<":"&lt;", ">":"&gt;"}
			if text:
				for specialChar in speecialChars:
					text = text.replace(specialChar,speecialChars[specialChar])
			return text		
		
	//method to get current timestamp. ##(MySQL will do it)
	put a string and a function as key:value in dict
	//get the key from a dict	(not needed: we can use dict[string] to refer value)
	get the value from a dict
		string = dict[string]
	method to remove first char
		string = string[1:]
	//check the end of file(not needed)
