simplification
	no gui
	this code is only for the server

resources we need
	that awkward cron
	python-mysql package(need exact name)

what actually we need to know
	about classes __init__
	
	python mysql *s
	python to access intrnet and download file
	extract .gz s with python
	root access with python
	format(),partition(),strip(),split(),replace(),
	lists,dicts
	try: except  Exception as error:
	cron jobs
	create tar.gz package
	create .deb package	
	read .ini s
	

	
what we think we do
	a code to trigger this program to run automatically
		need to messin with crons(may be them will be put on post inst in a deb)
	a code to identify repo change
		need to create remote connection with repo
	a code to get Packages.gz fileset
		need to download packages.gz files
		and to extract them
	a code to insert their data into software database
		we did this as php
		we need to connect to db
	a code to set dependancies
		done but need to modify
	a code to set tags
		need to get them from db
		:: and comma matters
		need 4 fields
			id
			soft_id
			tag_value1
			tag_value2
	need to create a ini file to store data about db and repo
		db init
		repository
		ubuntu version
	need a .py to connect to database
		common dbconnect
		select
			
		create
			table if not exsists
		insert
			delayed
			ignore
		drop table in each data insert(this is the easy way for deps and tags)
